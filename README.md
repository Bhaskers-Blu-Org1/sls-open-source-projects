- Description:
  Highly-customizable Ansible role for installing and configuring IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS).

- User story:
  A client who already invested heavily in infrastructure automation based on Red Hat Ansible was conducting a proof of concept (PoC) with IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS). Automating deployment of all infrastructure components was a key requirement for the client, which is why Lab Services was engaged to develop necessary playbooks for Spectrum Scale. The client agreed to publishing those playbooks as open source, hence the code could be re-used during other client engagements and is actively being maintained and enhanced based on client requirements.
